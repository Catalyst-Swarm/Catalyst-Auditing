Documented on this miro board : [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOdpYqTI=/](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOdpYqTI=/)
{% endhint %}

#### Objective: Shareable brainstorm

1: Listen to inputs about how we all understand demonstrating ROI

2: Participate in activities to identify issues and solutions

3: Record and reflect on session!

**Problem statement :**&#x20;

Funded projects and teams within IO have different ideas about what Metrics / KPIs / OKRs are meaningful in Catalyst & this makes it difficult to demonstrate Funded-project's & Catalyst Challenge ROI to community.&#x20;

How do we know if a Challenge was achieved or if ROI to the Challenge was positive?&#x20;

3 audiences we aim to satisfy:&#x20;

1\. Funded-Projects (setting & reporting KPIs/OKRs for accountability)&#x20;

2\. Community (who need transparency about funded-project ROI)&#x20;

3\. Internal stakeholders (so IOG can be responsive & communicate Catalyst ROI)

**Activity 1**: How do you feel about the current KPI & Progress reporting process & how would you improve it?&#x20;

1\) 1-3 ideas each to KPI challenges \[YELLOW]    5 mins

2\) Communicate ideas to group       5 mins

3\) What are your ideas for solutions \[TURQUOISE] 10 mins

4\) Considerations for opening up KPI data \[GREEN] 5 mins&#x20;

**Outcome :** Some starter stickies have been added from insights shared by Funded projects from Tuesday 11th Jan Coordinator meeting
