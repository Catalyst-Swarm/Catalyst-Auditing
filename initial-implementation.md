# Initial implementation

### **Identity (Proposer and proposal)**

Initially not implemented as using trusted community members for first pilot implementation. This will require authorization and verification steps to release to all funded cohort participants in a future rollout.

In a future rollout verification could include using email verification for the short term before ideally moving to an Atala Prism identity solution once an integration can be made in the longer term.



### Proposal management (Milestones and KPIs)

The milestones and KPIs of each proposal will need to be managed by the proposers. They should be able to update these values when needed.



### **Reporting (Progress and KPI)**

Proposers will need a way to add both progress and KPI reports against their proposals milestones and KPIs.
