## Data that could be omitted

Some of the data above can be omitted for a general purpose reporting system for Project Catalyst moving forward.

**Progress report - Reporting questions that can be omitted**

* Work started on proposal - This is true most times people are filling out the report so is a repetitive question. Instead the proposer can be asked what is the status of a proposal such as not-started, in-progress or blocked. If it's not-started or blocked then they can mention why but a proposal status question captures more valuable information than whether work has been started on a proposal.
* Project on track? - This question will often be true, or mostly true and is often not a binary answer. For instance if a proposer thought they were a few days behind it is more useful to know that against their milestones roadmap than a binary answer of whether they are off track. Milestone tracking which provides a better yes or no answer whether further details can be added if necessary captures this information more clearly.
* Catalyst attention required for issue? - Asking this question every report is likely not necessary, and instead contact details can be given or a separate form if a proposal needs help from Catalyst or another aiding body. This makes sense for IOG to capture in the short term for them to help however wouldn't make sense in a general purpose reporting process.
* Going live date for project - This is a repetitive question to ask for each progress report. In an ideal world this date is part of a set of milestones which would get updated on the proposal as and when needed rather than being repeatedly stated in a progress report.
* Collaboration over last month - This is a question that may never apply to a proposal. Due to this it may make sense for this to be part of the standard what happened section where a tip is given to mention collaborations if they are noteworthy.
* Other important developments - Can be included in a general progress update about what happened.
* Questions for Catalyst team - Not required for a general purpose reporting system, however is useful in the early stages for IOG with their current process.
* Happiness with the development of the project - This could be added in the progress update text as isn't something people need to answer every time they do an update. There is less value in the answer when things are just moving along roughly as intended.

**KPI report - Reporting questions that can be omitted**

* Developers engaged since beginning - Only applies to certain proposals, can be added as a KPI metric if it was needed for the relevant challenges.
* Number of products & services generated - Only applies to certain proposals, can be added as a KPI metric if it was needed for the relevant challenges.
* Describe product or service - Repeated question in each progress report wouldn't be necessary. This data is better suited as part of general proposal information or further details could be added if a completion report was done at the end of a proposal.
* Collaborations due to participation in project - Doesn't add much value asking this every report, could be included in the progress report main update as this would also be irregular to occur rather than every few weeks.&#x20;
* Project KPIs being measured - Ideally not asked every few weeks and instead if maintained in a single place and updated as required. The place to maintain this information could be the auditing system.&#x20;
* Approach to tracking and relevance of KPIs - Ideally not asked every few weeks and instead if maintained in a single place and updated as required. The place to maintain this information could be the auditing system.
