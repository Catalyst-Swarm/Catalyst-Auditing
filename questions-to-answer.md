# Questions to answer

* **Reporting types to represent success and issue types** - The success and issues a proposal faces whilst execution are an important thing to highlight. It helps highlight achievements that come out during execution to share with the community and also shares issues that can help lead to support from the community.&#x20;
  * Should we use the same reporting type list of options for both success and issues? The simplicity makes sense as it makes the groupings easier to learn and use
  * Should the reporting types be more granular? The suggested types cover a wide range of categories but could benefit from being more granular. The issue with being more granular is it would make it more difficult to use however the reporting would be more accurate. Which trade off is most important?
* **Milestones and KPI data model** - More thought is needed on what data would be needed to store.
* **Reporting blockers - **The data model currently suggests to have a blocker as a single piece of text with the progress status of a proposal. This information could also go on the issue part of a progress report instead or in addition to. The reason this should be considered as an alternative is often proposals will be blocked in one or a few areas but potentially not other areas of the proposal that they can work on. You could also use the issues that can be marked as blockers as an alternative to marking a proposal as blocked to support this use case where the proposal is still in progress but it has some blockers.
